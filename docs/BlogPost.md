Building the Future of No-Code: A Candid Chat with Smash Capital’s Kate

Introduction

Ever wonder what happens when a venture capitalist who loves to cook—but hates food waste—decides to build a personal cooking app with zero coding experience? Meet Katherine from Smash Capital. In our conversation, she shares insights into her journey with Lovable, the trends she’s seeing in AI, and why building software no longer has to be a privilege limited to technical experts.

TL;DR

Real-World Needs Fuel Innovation: Kate’s cooking app began with a genuine personal pain point: too many groceries, too little time.

Democratizing Software: AI-driven no-code solutions like Lovable dramatically lower the barrier to entry for non-technical creators.

Iterate Faster: Getting the “foundation” of an app is faster than ever, which frees creators to hone their vision and user experience.

Build with Purpose: Kate’s advice? Pick an idea you truly love—it’ll naturally push you to learn essential tools and keep growing.

Who Is Kate and Smash Capital?

S: Kate, tell us a bit about yourself and what led you to Lovable.

K: Sure. I’m a software investor at Smash Capital, where I’ve been for about two years now. We focus heavily on software and AI. Half of our team comes from traditional VC backgrounds like Insight or Lightspeed, and the other half includes folks who were instrumental at Disney—launching Disney+, acquiring Marvel and Pixar. As a firm, we’re big on brand strategy and building the next generation of consumer-facing products.

The Cooking App

S: So that’s how your cooking app came to life. Can you walk us through the process?

K: On a personal note, I love cooking but tend to be wasteful. I’ll buy a bunch of groceries for one nice meal, and then half of it ends up going bad. It’s frustrating. So, I started experimenting with Lovable because I’d been playing around with OpenAI ChatGPT for recipes. But I wanted a more interactive interface, something I could share with friends or roommates. That’s when I realized Lovable could help me quickly build an actual app—without me having to code from scratch.

It started as a simple idea. I used ChatGPT for recipe ideas but soon realized I could shape that into a real product using Lovable.

The platform gave me design templates, pointed out missing pieces, and helped me iterate. Before I knew it, I had a functional base for my cooking app.

S: That’s amazing. Any standout moments?

K: The sheer speed of it all. I’ve never seen a product go from concept to functional so fast. Also, seeing how Lovable “thinks” about UI/UX was eye-opening. It was like having a personal teacher guiding me on what’s possible.

S: You mentioned using tools like Supabase and ChatGPT on the back end. How did that come about?

K: Initially, I’d run into a few limitations. Lovable would generate partial solutions or less helpful outputs. I realized, “Okay, I need to integrate a database like Supabase,” or “I should connect ChatGPT to get more sophisticated recipe logic.” Each step taught me how these pieces fit together. Now that I’ve done it once, if I had to build this again, I could do it in half the time.

The first time you run into an error can actually be a huge learning experience in no-code tools. It’s all about education—figuring out what’s possible and what might require additional integrations.

S: Did you ever dig into the code Lovable produced?

K: I did, but more so with help from ChatGPT. I’d paste code into ChatGPT, ask “What is this doing?” or “How can I fix this error?” It was a great two-pronged approach: Lovable for the interface and scaffolding, ChatGPT for code explanations. I even tried Lovable’s own Chat Mode, which acts like a built-in project manager or designer. It’s very convenient.

S: What’s your top tip for someone just starting with Lovable?

K: Start with an idea you truly care about; you’ll stay motivated. Then familiarize yourself with the core functions you’ll need—database storage, web scraping, alerts—whatever suits your project. Once you see how these pieces fit, you can build all kinds of apps. I’m already exploring a new idea in the fashion space, where I’d track designer sales using web scraping tools. Understanding how to mix and match features is key.

Navigating the AI Landscape as a VC

S: Kate, from an investor’s perspective, what broader AI or no-code trends are you seeing right now?

K: We’re looking at a huge range of products. Some focus on technical co-pilots for engineers, while others address low-code solutions for teams with a bit of coding expertise. Then there’s Lovable’s end-to-end approach, where it’s completely no-code, and you own the whole stack. That’s revolutionary because it truly democratizes software creation.

When I first used open AI tools, that “magical” feeling of doing something quickly and effectively without specialized knowledge was huge. Lovable extends that magic by letting non-technical folks like me build real apps. As a VC, I see that as an incredibly impactful wave—letting anyone with a problem or idea spin up solutions.

Conclusion

This conversation underscores one truth: the world of software development is more accessible than ever. Kate’s journey with Lovable reveals how quickly a personal pain point—wasted groceries—can be tackled by a non-technical user with the right no-code platform.

With AI-driven features, integrated tools, and a remarkably intuitive experience, Lovable has allowed Kate to build (and learn) at speeds she never thought possible. For anyone sitting on a promising idea, Kate’s story proves you don’t have to be a coder to make it happen. All it takes is an appetite for innovation—and maybe a few leftover ingredients in the fridge.
